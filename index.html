<h3>Claim Your Domain -- And Own Your Online Presence</h3>
<br />
<p><img style="margin: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/claimyourdomainownyouronlinepresence-265_2.jpg" alt="" align="right" />Too often, education technologies are developed that position students as <em>objects</em> of education, a reflection no doubt of how traditional educational practices also view students. Education technologies do things <em>to</em> students, rather than foster student agency. If we are to challenge what "school" should look like, we must also challenge what "ed-tech" does as well. What sorts of technologies can and should we build to give students more control? What sorts of technologies can offer students the power to "own" their learning -- their data, their content, their digital profiles, and their domain?</p>
